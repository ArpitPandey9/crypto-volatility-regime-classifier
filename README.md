# Crypto Volatility Regime Classifier

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project implements a **state-of-the-art machine learning pipeline** to classify volatility regimes (`Low`, `Medium`, `High`) for multiple cryptocurrencies based on advanced technical features.

Using **XGBoost**, robust **walk-forward validation**, and **SHAP explainability**, the model predicts the short-term volatility environment—crucial for risk management and strategy design in crypto quantitative finance.

## 📊 Key Features

- **Multi-crypto data**: BTC, ETH, LTC, BNB, SOL price and volume history (3 years, daily).
- **Rich feature engineering**: Returns, rolling volatility, momentum, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands width, and moving averages.
- **Target variable**: Volatility regime classes derived from BTC’s 7-day rolling volatility quantiles.
- **Walk-forward cross-validation** simulating real-world rolling retraining & testing.
- **XGBoost classifier** tuned with subsampling and regularization for performance & generalization.
- **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** used for detailed model interpretability and feature importance analysis.
- Modular and clean **Python code** organized into reusable components for feature generation, modeling, and explainability.
